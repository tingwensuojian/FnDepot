GenOffice is a free, open-source alternative to Microsoft Office for macOS,
Windows and Linux. It opens and saves native `.docx`, `.xlsx` and `.pptx`
files, edits PDF, Markdown and HTML, and puts an AI agent next to every
document — not a chat box bolted on the side, but an editor that reads the
file, makes the change, and shows you exactly what it touched.

- **Real formats, byte-preserving.** Only what you edit is rewritten. Everything
  else in the file survives byte-for-byte, so documents keep working in Word,
  Excel and PowerPoint.
- **AI you can review.** Edits land as tracked changes and diffs with one-click
  rollback. Spreadsheets get live formulas, not pasted numbers. Decks and pages
  are generated onto the canvas and stay fully editable.
- **Local by design.** Files open, edit, save and convert on your machine.
  PDF → Word / Excel / PowerPoint, Markdown → Word and HTML → Word all run
  on-device. Only the AI calls leave the machine, to the provider you choose.
- **Your keys or none.** Sign in with Genspark and skip keys, or bring your own
  key for Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, Doubao, MiniMax,
  Grok, Mistral, OpenRouter, Requesty, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, local
  servers included.
- **Scriptable and agent-ready.** The app ships a `genoffice` command line and
  a skill for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode
  and Windsurf, so a coding agent can create, convert, read and edit real
  Office files on your machine without opening a window.

## Demo

Six apps, one AI panel, and a command line for your coding agent. Every
screenshot is the real app on macOS, with the AI driven from the prompt you
can read in the panel.

### 1 · Docs — open and edit `.docx` with an AI you can review

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/docs-report.webp" alt="GenOffice Docs rendering a two-column annual-report page with a full-width cover image, shaded KPI table, header and footer, at 80% zoom with the AI panel collapsed"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/docs-ai.webp" alt="GenOffice Docs: a company overview with a banner image; the AI tightened the Overview and inserted a new bulleted section, and the panel offers a one-click roll back"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Opens the file as Word lays it out</b> — two-column sections, full-bleed images, shaded tables, headers and footers, pagination on Word's line metrics. Styles, comments, tracked changes, equations and ink round-trip untouched.</td>
<td><b>Ask for the edit</b> — the AI reads the blocks it needs, rewrites the Overview and inserts a new bulleted section. Every AI turn is a snapshot you can roll back; with <b>Track changes</b> on, edits arrive as Word-style revisions.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 2 · Sheets — `.xlsx` with live formulas and charts, not pasted numbers

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/sheets-ai.webp" alt="GenOffice Sheets: the AI added a Summary sheet with revenue by region and category using SUMIF formulas, plus a column chart, and reports 43 applied changes with an Undo button"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/sheets-qa.webp" alt="GenOffice Sheets: asked which region led Q2 revenue, the AI answers Europe with the category breakdown and cites the cells it used as links, next to the Orders sheet"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Build it</b> — from one sentence the agent adds a Summary sheet with real <code>SUMIF</code>s by region and category, inserts a column chart, and applies the 43 changes as a single undoable batch.</td>
<td><b>Ask it</b> — questions about the workbook come back with the reasoning and the exact cells used as clickable citations. Under the hood: an in-house Rust <code>.xlsx</code> engine, pivot tables, slicers, conditional formatting and formula tracing.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 3 · Slides — from a prompt to a `.pptx` deck

<img src="docs/assets/readme/slides-generate.webp" alt="Time-lapse of GenOffice Slides generating the Aurora Home investor deck: the AI plans the storyline in the panel, slides appear on the canvas one after another, and the finished deck ends on the closing ask" width="100%">

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/slides-cover.webp" alt="GenOffice Slides: the cover slide of an AI-generated Aurora Home investor deck on the canvas, with the original one-line prompt and the AI's summary of what it built in the panel"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/slides-ai.webp" alt="GenOffice Slides: the designed closing slide of the same 11-slide deck, with the thumbnail strip on the left and the AI panel summarizing the storyline"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>One line in</b> — "Create a 10-slide investor pitch deck for Aurora Home…". GenOffice plans the storyline, researches the numbers, and drafts every slide onto the canvas as a real <code>.pptx</code>.</td>
<td><b>A finished deck out</b> — eleven designed slides with consistent typography, imagery and a closing call to action; keep editing with masters, layouts, smart guides and non-destructive cropping, or ask the panel to restyle, rewrite and reorder.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 4 · PDF — edit PDF text in place, convert PDF to Word on-device

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/pdf-edit.webp" alt="GenOffice PDF: Edit text mode outlines every text block on the page for in-place editing while the AI panel answers a question about the report with page citations"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/pdf-convert.webp" alt="GenOffice Docs showing a Word document converted locally from the Helios quarterly review PDF, opened in a second tab beside the original PDF"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Edit inside the page</b> — Edit text mode outlines every text block for in-place retyping; the content stream is rewritten through PDFium with the original fonts, not a cover-up annotation. Ask the AI about a long report and get answers with page citations.</td>
<td><b>Convert on-device</b> — <b>PDF Converter → PDF to Word</b> produces an editable <code>.docx</code> that opens in Docs next to the source, headings, stat rows and paragraphs intact. Excel and PowerPoint targets work the same way; scanned pages go through the system OCR.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 5 · HTML — an AI page and UI builder, design brief first

Say what the page is for and who it is for. The AI proposes a **design brief**
first — hook, palette, typography and style directions — then builds a single
self-contained `.html` file against those tokens.

<img src="docs/assets/readme/html-restyle-motion.webp" alt="Time-lapse of GenOffice HTML restyling the Lumen landing page: one Restyle request in the panel turns the dark Midnight Studio page into the warm Solar Daybreak version while every section and all copy stay in place" width="100%">

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/html-ai.webp" alt="GenOffice HTML: a generated landing page for a solar desk lamp in the dark Midnight Studio direction, shown in the live preview with the AI panel summarizing the page it just built"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/html-restyle.webp" alt="The same Lumen landing page restyled by the AI into the warm Solar Daybreak direction: paper background, serif headlines and an orange accent, with every section and all copy kept"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Generated from one prompt</b> — a bold hero, feature cards, pricing and a waitlist form for Lumen, built in the Midnight Studio direction. Click any element to restyle it, double-click to edit text, or switch to the CodeMirror source view.</td>
<td><b>Same design, new direction</b> — one <b>Restyle</b> request swaps the brief's tokens and the page follows: warm paper, editorial serif, sun-orange accent, nothing rewritten. Present fullscreen, or export as PDF or a native editable Word document.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/html-dashboard.webp" alt="GenOffice HTML: a generated personal dashboard UI for a freelance designer in a warm linen style, with a left rail, serif greeting and four metric cards"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/html-report.webp" alt="GenOffice HTML: a generated EV-market data report in a broadsheet style, with a serif masthead, a 17.3 million headline figure and a stat row"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>UI mockups</b> — the "personal dashboard" starter turns a persona into a working layout: left rail, greeting, billable-hours sparkline, invoice and utilization cards, all real HTML you can hand to a developer.</td>
<td><b>Data stories</b> — the "data report" starter builds an editorial broadsheet: serif masthead, one headline number, a rule-separated stat row, inline SVG charts and a methodology note.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 6 · Markdown — a block editor over plain `.md`, with Ask AI

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/markdown-ai.webp" alt="GenOffice Markdown: a selected paragraph shows an Ask AI popover with a typed instruction and suggestion chips such as Polish, Make more concise, Expand and Fix grammar, plus Send now and Add to queue buttons"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/markdown-render.webp" alt="GenOffice Markdown rendering a launch-notes document with a table, a Mermaid flowchart and a task list, with the AI panel's starter prompts on the left"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Ask AI about a selection</b> — select any passage and an <b>Ask AI</b> chip appears: type an instruction or pick a suggestion, send it now, or queue several anchored edits and run them in one pass. The same entry exists in every app.</td>
<td><b>Rendered, saved as plain Markdown</b> — headings, lists, tables, images, code blocks and Mermaid diagrams in a Tiptap block editor, written back as plain <code>.md</code>, with a fully local <b>Markdown → Word</b> export.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### 7 · CLI — your coding agent drives GenOffice, on your machine

GenOffice ships a `genoffice` command line and an agent skill. Install the
skill and Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode or
Windsurf can create, convert, read and edit real Office files through the
same engines as the apps, without opening a window.

<img src="docs/assets/readme/cli-deck-in-app.webp" alt="GenOffice Slides showing an eight-slide Solar System deck that a coding agent built through the genoffice command line: the cover slide on the canvas, eight thumbnails on the left and the AI panel open" width="100%">

<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/cli-slides-grid.webp" alt="The eight rendered slides of the Solar System deck side by side: cover, exploration timeline, four key numbers, planet-diameter bar chart, rocky worlds versus giants, the Sun's 99.8% hero number, the four giants grid and takeaways"></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="docs/assets/readme/cli-integrations.webp" alt="GenOffice Settings, Integrations page: the genoffice skill installed into Claude Code, with Install buttons next to Codex and Cursor"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>One prompt to your agent</b> — "Build an eight-slide deck about the Solar System." The agent reads the skill, writes a style sheet, an outline and one page spec per slide, generates the two photos with <code>genoffice image</code>, and lets <code>genoffice slides check</code> reject anything that overflows or overlaps before <code>genoffice create</code> assembles the <code>.pptx</code> and <code>slides render</code> hands back a PNG per slide to look at.</td>
<td><b>Install once, from Settings → Integrations</b> — GenOffice lists the coding agents it finds on this computer and writes the skill into each one you pick. Or download the skill as a zip, or run <code>npx skills add genspark-ai/genoffice</code>. Commands and the full workflow are in <a href="#command-line-and-agent-skill">Command line and agent skill</a>.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Why GenOffice

- **Open source**, Apache-2.0, built in the open on GitHub.
- **Yours to run.** Native apps for macOS, Windows and Linux; files stay on your
  disk and every edit, save and conversion happens on your machine.
- **Real Office files.** Native `.docx`, `.xlsx` and `.pptx`, byte-preserving:
  the parts of a file you did not touch are copied exactly as they were.
- **An AI that edits the document itself.** Tracked changes in Docs, live
  formulas and charts in Sheets, slides drawn onto the canvas, every AI turn a
  snapshot you can roll back.
- **Your model, your key.** Sign in with Genspark, or bring a key for Claude,
  OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek and more, local servers and any OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint included.
- **PDF done properly.** Edit text inside the page, and convert PDF to Word,
  Excel or PowerPoint on-device, with system OCR for scans.
- **Markdown and HTML too**, with the same AI panel and local export to Word.
- **Scriptable.** A `genoffice` command line and an agent skill put every
  engine at the service of Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and other coding agents,
  still on-device.
- **Free**, for individuals and teams alike.

## AI backends

**Sign in with Genspark** and there is nothing to configure: model calls route
through the Genspark proxy (Claude, GPT and Gemini families) and the agents get
web and image search, image generation, and image/audio/video analysis.

**Or bring your own key.** Settings → AI lists Claude, OpenAI, Gemini,
DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, Doubao, MiniMax, Grok, Mistral, OpenRouter, Requesty
and OpenCode Zen/Go, plus a custom slot for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (base
URL + key), including local model servers. Search and media have their own
per-capability providers under **AI Media & Search**: Serper or Tavily for web
search, and OpenAI, Gemini, Doubao/Seedream, GLM, Grok, Qwen, MiniMax or any
OpenAI-compatible images endpoint for image generation and image/video
analysis.

The whole suite ships light, dark and system themes. Themes only change what
is on screen: exports, prints and saved files always keep the document's own
colors.

## Command line and agent skill

Everything the apps can do to a file, the `genoffice` command line can do from
a terminal: inspect, convert, create, read and edit Word, Excel, PowerPoint,
PDF, Markdown and HTML on the same engines, headless. It installs with
GenOffice, needs no runtime of its own, and never sends a document anywhere.
Paired with the bundled **agent skill**, it turns a coding agent into a
document worker that produces real Office files instead of Markdown
approximations.

**Works with:** Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot,
OpenCode and Windsurf out of the box, and any other agent that reads skills.

### Install the skill

| How                                    | What happens                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Settings → Integrations** in the app | Lists the agents found on this computer; one click writes the skill into each one you choose. An **Update** button appears when a GenOffice release ships a newer skill. |
| **Download as zip** on the same page   | The layout claude.ai, the Claude desktop apps and other assistants accept as an uploaded skill.                                                                          |
| `npx skills add genspark-ai/genoffice` | Installs from this repository into any skills-compatible agent.                                                                                                          |

Then start a new chat and ask for a document. The skill teaches the agent when
to reach for `genoffice`, how to read a file before editing it, and how to
check its own work.

### Quickstart from the terminal

```bash
genoffice --version
genoffice info report.docx --json                  # headings and blocks; or sheets, slides, pages
genoffice convert report.md --to pdf               # md/html/docx/xlsx/pptx → pdf, pdf → docx/xlsx/pptx, …
genoffice create --type docx --from notes.md --out notes.docx
genoffice create --type xlsx --from table.json --out sales.xlsx   # "=SUM(B2:B9)" cells stay live formulas
genoffice docs read report.docx --range 0-9 --json # then `docs apply --ops edits.json` edits in place
genoffice render report.docx --out shots/          # one PNG per page, to look at what you made
genoffice open sales.xlsx                          # hand the result to the editor
```

Every command prints a one-line summary, or a single JSON object with
`--json`. Edits are atomic: a rejected op leaves the file untouched and comes
back with a guided error. `genoffice help` lists the current command surface;
the full reference is [packages/cli/README.md](packages/cli/README.md).

### What the agent actually runs

The Solar System deck in the [demo](#demo) took one prompt in Claude Code.
Behind it, the agent followed the skill's staged workflow and the CLI checked
every stage before the next one started:

```bash
genoffice capabilities --json                        # which cloud tools GenOffice has configured
genoffice guide slides design                        # the deck workflow and layout library
genoffice image "the eight planets in a row …" --aspect 16:9 --out deck/assets/cover.jpg
genoffice slides check deck/outline.json --json      # 8 pages, no findings
genoffice slides check deck/pages/01.json --json     # builds one slide, audits overflow and overlap
…                                                    # one page file per slide, fixed until each check is clean
genoffice create --type pptx --spec deck/pages --outline deck/outline.json --out deck/solar-system.pptx --json
genoffice slides render deck/solar-system.pptx --out deck/shots --json
genoffice slides audit deck/solar-system.pptx --json    # 8 slides, no layout issues
genoffice slides replace deck/solar-system.pptx --slide 4 --spec deck/pages/05.json --json
genoffice open deck/solar-system.pptx
```

No model call happens inside `genoffice`: the agent does the thinking, the CLI
does the building and the checking, and the result opens in GenOffice or
PowerPoint as an ordinary `.pptx`.

All builds come from `main`; the macOS and Windows installers are signed.

<details>
<summary><b>Installing on Linux</b></summary>

The deb installs with apt — it pulls in the dependencies and adds GenOffice
to the applications menu:

```bash
sudo apt install ./genoffice_<version>_amd64.deb
```

On Fedora / RHEL-family / openSUSE, install the rpm instead:

```bash
sudo dnf install ./genoffice-<version>.x86_64.rpm     # Fedora / RHEL family
sudo zypper install ./genoffice-<version>.x86_64.rpm  # openSUSE
```

The AppImage runs in place: install the FUSE 2 runtime
(`sudo apt install libfuse2`; on Ubuntu 24.04 the package is `libfuse2t64`),
make the file executable, then run it:

```bash
chmod +x GenOffice-<version>.AppImage
./GenOffice-<version>.AppImage
```

</details>

## How it works

Seven Electron apps — Docs, Sheets, Slides, PDF, Markdown, HTML and the
tabbed shell — share one engine layer of pure TypeScript packages plus a Rust
sidecar for `.xlsx`. The original file is always the source of truth: edits
are applied as narrow patches, and everything the editor did not touch
survives the round trip untouched.

```
open docx ─► archive original by hash (never touched)
          ─► parse word/document.xml into a block tree, each block anchored to its original XML
          ─► Tiptap editor (manual + AI editing, dirty tracking)
save      ─► dirty blocks → OOXML fragments (referencing existing styles only)
          ─► splice into the original document.xml; untouched blocks keep their bytes
          ─► repack the zip; every other entry is copied byte-for-byte
```

The package-by-package tour (docx/pptx engines, `pdf2docx`, `html2docx`, the
agent core and providers) lives in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#engine-packages).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run fixtures     # generate test .docx fixtures
npm test             # engine + app unit tests (docs/sheets/slides need no display)
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit across every workspace
npm run dev          # all six editors + shell against Vite dev servers
npm run dev:docs     # a single app (same pattern works per workspace)
npm run dist:mac     # package macOS dmg (regenerates third-party notices)
npm run dist:win     # package Windows nsis installer
npm run dist:linux   # package Linux AppImage + deb + rpm
```

The sheets app additionally needs a Rust toolchain for its xlsx sidecar
(`cargo` on PATH); `npm run build -w @genoffice/sheets` compiles it
automatically. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the checks every
change must pass and how pull requests land.

<summary><b>Can GenOffice open Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint files?</b></summary>

Yes. GenOffice opens and saves native `.docx`, `.xlsx` and `.pptx` files.
Saving is byte-preserving: parts of the file you didn't touch are written
back byte-for-byte, so documents keep working in Microsoft Office.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does GenOffice work offline?</b></summary>

Document editing is fully local — files never leave your machine to be
opened, edited, saved or converted. The AI features (agents, search, image
tools) need a network connection, with either a Genspark sign-in or your own
model API key.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can GenOffice edit PDF files?</b></summary>

Yes — real PDF text and image editing that rewrites the page content stream
with the original fonts preserved, not cover-up annotations.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can GenOffice convert PDF to Word, Excel or PowerPoint?</b></summary>

Yes — entirely on-device: PDFium character-level extraction plus
geometry-based layout analysis, no cloud service, no upload. Scanned pages
are covered too: on macOS and Windows the system OCR reads them, so they
convert to editable text rather than a page image.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use my own AI model or API key?</b></summary>

Yes. Besides the keyless Genspark sign-in, GenOffice supports bring your own
key for Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, Doubao, MiniMax,
Grok, Mistral, OpenRouter, Requesty and OpenCode Zen/Go, plus any OpenAI-compatible
endpoint — including local model servers. Search, image generation and
image/video analysis take their own keys under Settings → AI Media & Search.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can GenOffice convert HTML to Word?</b></summary>

Yes — Export as Word in the HTML app produces a native, editable `.docx`
entirely on-device. The page is rendered in the built-in Chromium and reduced
to real Word structures: headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, cards, KPI rows,
form fields and page backgrounds; only visuals with no Word counterpart
(charts, icons, decorated boxes) are embedded as pictures.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I drive GenOffice from Claude Code, Codex, Cursor or a script?</b></summary>

Yes. GenOffice installs a `genoffice` command line that runs the same engines
headless: inspect, convert, create, read and edit documents from a terminal or
a script, with `--json` output for programs. The bundled agent skill teaches
Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode and Windsurf
to use it; install it from **Settings → Integrations**. See
[Command line and agent skill](#command-line-and-agent-skill).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does GenOffice collect any data?</b></summary>

Official packaged builds send limited usage analytics by default, and you can
disable reporting at any time under Settings → General. Analytics never sends
document content, file names, file paths, account identity or email
addresses. See [GenOffice Privacy](PRIVACY.md) for the complete event and
data disclosures.
